## a Love Declaration

Let me start with a bit about my journey: I earned an **MSc in Physics** in 2018, during which I discovered my deep passion for learning‚Äîand my newfound love for coding.
- Here's my [scientific publication](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ab7a30/meta), based on my graduation thesis.
- And a [collection](https://github.com/markort147?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=c) of **C code** I wrote while exploring simulations and algorithms during my studies.

After graduating, I decided to transition into software development, where I found my second love: Java (though my first love will always be C).
- Feel free to explore my [Java repositories](https://github.com/markort147?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=java).
- Oh, and if you‚Äôre a Magic: The Gathering fan, don‚Äôt miss [XMage](https://github.com/magefree/mage), an **open-source** app I proudly contribute to.

For the past six years, I‚Äôve been dedicating my efforts to supporting the customer care systems of a major Italian telecommunications and broadband company. 
But my curiosity has never been content to sit still. 
In the early years, I focused on mastering Java, but in 2023, I ventured into the world of **ML and Data Science through** a bootcamp. 
It was the perfect opportunity to reconnect with **Python** and explore the vast field of data analysis and forecasting.
- Check out my [certification](https://github.com/markort147/markort147.github.io/blob/main/assets/neural_academy.pdf).
- And a [notebook](https://github.com/markort147?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=jupyter+notebook) showcasing what I learned during that journey.

It was a fascinating experience, and I‚Äôd love to keep working in that space. But my restless spirit soon turned to my third love: **Go**, which became my focus throughout 2024.
- Take a look at my [Go repositories](https://github.com/markort147?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=go). I know, they‚Äôre still few in number, but my head is full of ideas‚ÄîI can‚Äôt wait to bring them to life and share them with you!

Meanwhile, Java has been transforming into a much more dynamic, performant, and powerful language than it used to be. It‚Äôs been exciting to witness its evolution firsthand.
Where this polyamorous journey will lead, I can‚Äôt say for sure, but one thing is certain: my enthusiasm and curiosity will never waver.

Oh, and speaking of new loves‚Äîdo you know [HTMX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7v6SNIgJpE&t)? I think I‚Äôm about to fall head over heels again.
