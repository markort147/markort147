I'm a software developer with a background in [quantum information physics](https://www.quantumlab.it/), currently working as a Research Assistant at the [Brain Physics Lab](https://icmplus.neurosurg.cam.ac.uk/home), University of Cambridge. I‚Äôm exploring ways to combine data analysis, code, and scientific research‚Äîespecially in areas where physiology and computation meet.

Before this, I worked as a backend software engineer in the IT consultancy world, mainly focused on [Java](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Amarkort147+topic%3Ajava&type=repositories), Spring Boot, Groovy, and a bit of everything from Bash scripting to SQL and JavaScript. These days, I‚Äôm still coding for fun‚Äîoften in [Go](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Amarkort147+topic%3Ago&type=repositories)‚Äîand staying active in the Go community.

Lately I‚Äôve been experimenting with [Docker](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Amarkort147+topic%3Ahtmx&type=repositories) and [HTMX](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Amarkort147+topic%3Ahtmx&type=repositories), trying out new ways to build and deploy lightweight tools. I enjoy working on clean, maintainable systems and learning by building.
